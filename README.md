     - Installing Express, CORS and body-parser.
     - create get and post API to control reqused and responsed data.
     - generate a public key from openWeather API and use it as a url header for the application. 
     - using vanilla js to control HTML elements and add action listener to the generate button.
     - handling date and data from the weather API and add it to the HTML elements.
